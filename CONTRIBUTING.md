# Contributing to the project

You'll need to proxy requests from `*.smallweb.localhost:443` to `localhost:7777` to run the project locally. The easiest to achieve is to use the following caddyfile:

```sh
smallweb.localhost, *.smallweb.localhost {
  reverse_proxy localhost:7777
}
```

You can follow the instructions from the [docs](https://www.smallweb.run/docs/hosting/local/) to find out how to install caddy locally.

> [!WARNING] Make sure to trust the certificate generated by caddy by running the `caddy trust` command.

If you're using MacOS, you'll also need to create the `/etc/resolver/localhost` file with the following content:

```sh
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

Then, all debug commands will use the example workspace located in the `examples` folder.
